  # The test case was failing here, because the compiler failed to
  # detect the two matrix instantiations as the same type.
  #
  # The root cause was that the `T` type variable is a different
  # type after the first Matrix type has been matched.
  #
  # Sigmatch was failing to match the second version of `T`, but
  # due to some complex interplay between tyOr, tyTypeDesc and
  # tyGenericParam this was allowed to went through. The generic
  # instantiation of the second matrix was incomplete and the
  # generic cache lookup failed, producing two separate types.
